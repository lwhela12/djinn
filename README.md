# Manifestation Journal Prototype

This repository contains the Manifestation Journal prototype.

## All-in-one Dev Startup

npm run dev        # starts backend & frontend in parallel
```

## Manual Setup (optional)

### Backend

cd backend
npm install
# configure environment variables in .env
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
